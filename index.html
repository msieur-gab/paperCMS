                        <h2>Designer, Technologist </h2>
                        <p>For over a vicennium, I've been navigating the intersection of design, technology, and cultural understanding. My journey has taken me from Europe to China, where immersion in traditional wisdom has profoundly shaped my approach to design and problem-solving.</p>

                        <h1>Professional Journey</h1>
                        <p>After establishing my foundation in design in Europe, I made the transformative decision to work in China. This experience has been more than a career move—it became a journey of discovery, leading me to explore how ancient principles can inform modern design challenges.</p>
                        
                        <p>My work spans across:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Digital product design and development</li>
                          <li>Cross-cultural design implementation</li>
                          <li>Integration of traditional principles in modern contexts</li>
                          <li>Design methodology development</li>
                        </ul>
                      
                        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
                        <p>Today, I blend traditional wisdom with contemporary design needs, exploring how timeless principles can address modern challenges. This approach has shaped my:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Design philosophy</li>
                          <li>Problem-solving methods</li>
                          <li>Understanding of user needs across cultures</li>
                          <li>Approach to sustainable and meaningful solutions</li>
                        </ul>
                      
                        <h2>About This Space</h2>
                        <p>This platform is where I share my ongoing journey of learning and creation. It's a collection of:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Insights gained from bridging Eastern and Western design principles</li>
                          <li>Practical applications of theoretical concepts</li>
                          <li>Explorations in making complex systems more accessible</li>
                          <li>Documentation of both successes and learning experiences</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>I believe in sharing knowledge openly and fostering discussion. Whether you're a designer, developer, or simply curious about the intersection of traditional wisdom and modern design, I hope you'll find value in these explorations.</p>

                          <h3>Exploration</h3>
                          <p>The bridge between thought and action. Through prototyping, experimentation, and iterative learning, we discover how theoretical insights can transform into practical methods.</p>
                          <p><em>Consider this our laboratory, where ideas meet reality.</em></p>
                        </div>
                      
                        <div>
                          <h3>Application</h3>
                          <p>Where theory and exploration culminate in tangible results. These are the concrete manifestations of our journey, from finished projects to practical solutions.</p>
                          <p><em>The realization of possibilities, where abstract becomes concrete.</em></p>

                        <p>Some paths may lead to fully realized projects, while others might remain as thought experiments or unfinished explorations. This incompleteness isn't a flaw—it's a reflection of how learning and creation truly work. Each unfinished branch holds potential for future discovery, waiting for the right moment or perspective to continue its growth.</p>
                      
                        <h3>How to Navigate</h3>
